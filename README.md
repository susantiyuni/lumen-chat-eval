```

## Usage Examples
Before running any examples, set your API key and base URL for the LLM. If you are using custom LLMs, they must be compatible with the OpenAI wrapper:
```
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
os.environ["OPENAI_BASE_URL"] = "https://baseurl.llm/v1"
```
or set these environment variables in terminal session:
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://baseurl.llm/v1"
```

### Single Judge:
Run a single LLM judge evaluation:
```
python lumen-examples/single.py
```

### Multi Judges:
Run multiple LLM judges simultaneously for consensus evaluation:
```
python lumen-examples/multi.py
```

## Overview 
`judges` is a small library to use and create LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators. The purpose of `judges` is to have a curated set of LLM evaluators in a low-friction format across a variety of use cases that are backed by research, and can be used off-the-shelf or serve as inspiration for building your own LLM evaluators.

## Installation
```
pip install judges
```

## API

### Types of Judges

The library provides two types of judges:

1. **Classifiers**: Return boolean values.
   - `True` indicates the inputs passed the evaluation.
   - `False` indicates the inputs did not pass the evaluation.

2. **Graders**: Return scores on a numerical or Likert scale.
   - Numerical scale: 1 to 5
   - Likert scale: terrible, bad, average, good, excellent

### Using Judges

All judges can be used by calling the `.judge()` method. This method accepts the following parameters:
- `input`: The input to be evaluated.
- `output`: The output to be evaluated.
- `expected` (optional): The expected result for comparison.

The `.judge()` method returns a `Judgment` object with the following attributes:
- `reasoning`: The reasoning behind the judgment.
- `score`: The score assigned by the judge.

### Classifier Judges

If the underlying prompt for a classifier judge outputs a `Judgment` similar to `True` or `False` (e.g., good or bad, yes or no, 0 or 1), the `judges` library automatically resolves the outputs so that a `Judgment` only has a boolean label.

### Combining Judges

The library also provides an interface to combine multiple judges through the `Jury` object. The `Jury` object has a `.vote()` method that produces a `Verdict`.

### Jury Object

- `.vote()`: Combines the judgments of multiple judges and produces a `Verdict`.

## Usage

### Pick a model
By default, `judges` uses [`instructor`](https://python.useinstructor.com/) for structured outputs and models due to its widespread use. To get started, set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` or whatever key you want for a specific model provider. Refer to the instructor docs for more providers.


### Send data to an LLM
Next, if you'd like to use this package, you can follow the examples in the `examples` directory, or follow the code below:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

question = "What is the name of the rabbit in the following story. Respond with 'I don't know' if you don't know."

story = """
Fig was a small, scruffy dog with a big personality. He lived in a quiet little town where everyone knew his name. Fig loved adventures, and every day he would roam the neighborhood, wagging his tail and sniffing out new things to explore.

One day, Fig discovered a mysterious trail of footprints leading into the woods. Curiosity got the best of him, and he followed them deep into the trees. As he trotted along, he heard rustling in the bushes and suddenly, out popped a rabbit! The rabbit looked at Fig with wide eyes and darted off.

But instead of chasing it, Fig barked in excitement, as if saying, "Nice to meet you!" The rabbit stopped, surprised, and came back. They sat together for a moment, sharing the calm of the woods.

From that day on, Fig had a new friend. Every afternoon, the two of them would meet in the same spot, enjoying the quiet companionship of an unlikely friendship. Fig's adventurous heart had found a little peace in the simple joy of being with his new friend.
"""

# set up the input prompt
input = f'{story}\n\nQuestion:{question}'

# write down what the model is expected to respond with
# NOTE: not all judges require an expected answer. refer to the implementations
expected = "I don't know"

# get the model output
output = client.chat.completions.create(
    model='gpt-4o-mini',
    messages=[
        {
            'role': 'user', 
            'content': input,
        },
    ],
).choices[0].message.content
```

### Use a `judges` classifier LLM as an evaluator model

```python
from judges.classifiers.correctness import PollMultihopCorrectness

# use the correctness classifier to determine if the first model
# answered correctly
correctness = PollMultihopCorrectness(model='openai/gpt-4o-mini')

judgment = correctness.judge(
    input=input,
    output=output,
    expected=expected,
)
print(judgment.reasoning)
# The 'Answer' provided ('I don't know') matches the 'Reference' text which also states 'I don't know'. Therefore, the 'Answer' correctly corresponds with the information given in the 'Reference'.

print(judgment.score)
# True
```

### Use a `Jury` for averaging and diversification

A jury of LLMs can enable more diverse results and enable you to combine the judgments of multiple LLMs.

```python
from judges import Jury
from judges.classifiers.correctness import PollMultihopCorrectness, RAFTCorrectness

poll = PollMultihopCorrectness(model='openai/gpt-4o')
raft = RAFTCorrectness(model='openai/gpt-4o-mini')

jury = Jury(judges=[poll, raft], voting_method="average")

verdict = jury.vote(
    input=input,
    output=output,
    expected=expected,
)
print(verdict.score)
```

### Use `AutoJudge` to create a custom LLM judge

`autojudge` is an extension to the **judges** library that builds on our [previous work](https://blog.quotientai.co/subject-matter-expert-language-liaison-smell-a-framework-for-aligning-llm-evaluators-to-human-feedback/) aligning judges to human feedback -- given a labeled dataset with feedback and a natural language description of an evaluation task, `autojudge` creates custom, task-specific LLM judges.

Install it using:  

```bash
pip install "judges[auto]"
```

**Step 1 - Prepare your dataset:**
Your dataset can be either a list of dictionaries or path to a csv file with the following fields:

- **`input`**: The input provided to your model
- **`output`**: The model's response
- **`label`**: `1` for correct, `0` for incorrect  
- **`feedback`**: Feedback explaining why the response is correct or incorrect

Example:  

| input                             | output                                                              | label | feedback                              |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------------------------------|
| What's the best time to visit Paris? | The best time to visit Paris is during the spring or fall.          | 1     | Provides accurate and detailed advice. |
| Can I ride a dragon in Scotland? | Yes, dragons are commonly seen in the highlands and can be ridden with proper training          | 0     | Dragons are mythical creatures; the information is fictional. |

**Step 2 - Initialize your `autojudge`:**
Provide a labeled dataset and describe the evaluation task.  

```python
from judges.classifiers.auto import AutoJudge

dataset = [
    {
        "input": "Can I ride a dragon in Scotland?",
        "output": "Yes, dragons are commonly seen in the highlands and can be ridden with proper training.",
        "label": 0,
        "feedback": "Dragons are mythical creatures; the information is fictional.",
    },
    {
        "input": "Can you recommend a good hotel in Tokyo?",
        "output": "Certainly! Hotel Sunroute Plaza Shinjuku is highly rated for its location and amenities. It offers comfortable rooms and excellent service.",
        "label": 1,
        "feedback": "Offers a specific and helpful recommendation.",
    },
    {
        "input": "Can I drink tap water in London?",
        "output": "Yes, tap water in London is safe to drink and meets high quality standards.",
        "label": 1,
        "feedback": "Gives clear and reassuring information.",
    },
    {
        "input": "What's the boiling point of water on the moon?",
        "output": "The boiling point of water on the moon is 100°C, the same as on Earth.",
        "label": 0,
        "feedback": "Boiling point varies with pressure; the moon's vacuum affects it.",
    }
]


# Task description
task = "Evaluate responses for accuracy, clarity, and helpfulness."

# Initialize autojudge
autojudge = AutoJudge.from_dataset(
    dataset=dataset,
    task=task,
    model="openai/gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09",
    # increase workers for speed ⚡
    # max_workers=2,
    # generated prompts are automatically saved to disk
    # save_to_disk=False,
)
```

**Step 3 - Use your judge to evaluate new input-output pairs:**
You can use `autojudge` to evaluate a single input-output pair using the `.judge()` method.  

```python
# Input-output pair to evaluate
input_ = "What are the top attractions in New York City?"
output = "Some top attractions in NYC include the Statue of Liberty and Central Park."

# Get the judgment
judgment = autojudge.judge(input=input_, output=output)

# Print the judgment
print(judgment.reasoning)
# The response accurately lists popular attractions like the Statue of Liberty and Central Park, which are well-known and relevant to the user's query.
print(judgment.score)
# True (correct)
```

## Creating Custom Judges

All judges inherit from the `BaseJudge` class and implement a `.judge()` method that returns a `Judgment` object.

### Basic Structure

```python
from textwrap import dedent
from judges.base import BaseJudge, Judgment

class MyCustomJudge(BaseJudge):
    def judge(
        self,
        input: str,
        output: str = None,
        expected: str = None,
    ) -> Judgment:
        """
        Judge the input and return a Judgment.
        
        Parameters:
        -----------
        input: str
            The input provided to the model to be judged.
        output: str  
            The output generated by the model.
        expected: str
            The expected output for comparison (optional).
        
        Returns:
        --------
        Judgment:
            The evaluation result containing the score and reasoning.
        """
        # Optional system-level instructions
        system_prompt = None
        user_prompt = dedent(
            f"""
            Your evaluation instructions here.
            
            Input: {input}
            Output: {output}
            Expected: {expected}
            
            Provide your judgment below:
            """
        )
        
        reasoning, score = self._judge(
            user_prompt=user_prompt,
            system_prompt=system_prompt,
        )
        
        return Judgment(reasoning=reasoning, score=score, score_type="boolean")
```

### Example: Politeness Judge

**Step 1: Define your evaluation criteria**

Start by clearly defining what you want to evaluate. For example, you might want to judge:
- Tone and politeness of responses
- Code quality and correctness  
- Creative writing style
- Factual accuracy in a specific domain

**Step 2: Create your judge class**
```python
from textwrap import dedent
from judges.base import BaseJudge, Judgment

class PolitenessJudge(BaseJudge):
    """
    A judge that evaluates the politeness and respectfulness of model responses.
    """
    
    def judge(
        self,
        input: str,
        output: str = None,
        expected: str = None,
    ) -> Judgment:
        system_prompt = "You are an expert in communication and social etiquette."
        
        user_prompt = dedent(
            f"""
            Evaluate whether the following response is polite and respectful.
            
            Original question: {input}
            Response to evaluate: {output}
            
            Consider factors like:
            - Use of courteous language
            - Respectful tone
            - Appropriate level of formality
            - Absence of rude or dismissive language
            
            Return "True" if the response is polite and respectful, "False" otherwise.
            """
        )
        
        reasoning, score = self._judge(
            user_prompt=user_prompt,
            system_prompt=system_prompt,
        )
        
        return Judgment(reasoning=reasoning, score=score, score_type="boolean")
```

**Step 3: Use your custom judge**
```python
# Initialize your judge
politeness_judge = PolitenessJudge(model='openai/gpt-4o-mini')

# Evaluate a response
judgment = politeness_judge.judge(
    input="Can you help me with my homework?",
    output="Sure! I'd be happy to help you with your homework. What subject are you working on?"
)

print(judgment.reasoning)
print(judgment.score)
# True
```

### Different Score Types

You can create judges that return different types of scores:

**Boolean judges** (True/False):
```python
return Judgment(reasoning=reasoning, score=score, score_type="boolean")
```

**Numerical judges** (1-5 scale):
```python
return Judgment(reasoning=reasoning, score=score, score_type="numerical")
```

**Likert scale judges** (terrible, bad, average, good, excellent):
```python
return Judgment(reasoning=reasoning, score=score, score_type="likert")
```


## CLI

`judges` also provides a command-line interface (CLI) for evaluating model outputs using various judges. The CLI supports both single and batch evaluations.

```bash
# Basic usage
judges <judge_type> --model <model_name> --input <json_input> [--output output_file]

# Example with a JSON string
judges PollMultihopCorrectness -m gpt-4o-mini -i '[
    {
        "input": "What is the capital of France?",
        "output": "The capital of France is Madrid.",
        "expected": "The capital of France is Paris."
    },
    {
        "input": "What is the capital of Germany?",
        "output": "The capital of Germany is Paris.",
        "expected": "The capital of Germany is Berlin."
    }
]'

# Example with output file
judges PollMultihopCorrectness --model gpt-4 --input test_cases.json --output results.json

# Using short options
judges PollMultihopCorrectness -m gpt-4 -i test_cases.json -o results.json
```

The CLI accepts the following parameters:
- `judge`: The type of judge to use (see [Classifiers](#classifiers-1))
- `--model` or `-m`: The name of the model to use (e.g., "gpt-4", "<provider>/<model_name>")
- `--input` or `-i`: Either a JSON string or path to a JSON file containing test cases
- `--output` or `-o` (optional): Path to save the results (if not provided, prints to stdout)

Each test case in the JSON input must have:
- `input`: The input provided to the model
- `output`: The output generated by the model

And optionally:
- `expected`: The expected output for comparison

The CLI will return a JSON object containing the original input, output, expected values, judgment score, and reasoning for each test case.
It will be saved to the output file or printed to `stdout` if no output file is specified.
